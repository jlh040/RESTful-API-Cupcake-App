### Cupcake App

This is an app that allows a user to create cupcakes. A RESTful API that I have created is being utilized so that everytime the user makes a cupcake, a request is sent to the API, which then communicates with the database to insert a new cupcake. Also, everytime the page refreshes or a new cupcake is created, a request is made to the API via AJAX/axios to get all the cupcakes from the database, and display them on the screen.
